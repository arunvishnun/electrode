# Contributing

PRs and issues are always welcome! We appreciate your interest in Electrode and offer to help.

There are [few guidelines](#contributing-guidelines) that we request contributors to follow.

## Getting Started

This is a mono-repo and we use [rushjs] for mono-repo management. Also, we use [pnpm] as the package manager along with [rushjs].
To read more about [rushjs with pnpm]

### Setup

Fork and clone the repo at <https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode.git> and bootstrap all the packages.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-id>/electrode.git
$ cd electrode
$ npm install -g @microsoft/rush # install rush
$ rush install # installs package dependencies for all packages, based on the shrinkwrap file (pnpm-lock) that got created/updated using rush update.
$ rush build # Run build command on all projects whose source files have changed since the last successful build
```

### Try a sample

Now you can go to the `samples` folder and try the `create-app-demo` sample app, develop and test your changes over there. This is the exact same app that our create-app package generates.

```bash
$ cd samples/create-app-demo
$ rushx dev
```

You should see some output in the console with `[DEV ADMIN]`. You can press `M` for the dev menu.

And when you open the browser at `http://localhost:3000`, you should see the demo web page.

### **Useful** Notes

- You should bootstrap the entire repo at the top dir at least once with `rush install`
- After you make changes to any module under packages, if you want to test them in one of the samples, just run `` rushx <command>`` in that sample and it will ensure all changed local packages are properly rebuilt and installed.

#### Test with `@xarc/create-app`

You can quickly use the `xarc-create-app` package to create an app for testing.

```bash
$ cd samples && node ../packages/xarc-create-app/src my-test-app
$ cd ../ && rush update
$ cd samples/my-test-app
$ 
$ rushx dev
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Submitting Pull Request

We appreciate any help you can offer. Please follow the guidelines on styling and commit messages here.

#### Styling

We are using [prettier] to format all our code with only one custom setting: `--print-width 100`. We are switching to version 2.

> If you are making changes to a file that has not been updated yet, please commit the format first before making your changes.

#### PR and Commit messages

Since we use independent lerna mode, to help keep the changelog clear, please format all your commit message with the following guideline:

`[<semver>][feat|bug|chore] <message>`

- `<semver>` can be:
  - `major` - `maj` or `major`
  - `minor` - `min` or `minor`
  - `patch` - `pat` or `patch`
- Only include `[feat|bug|chore]` if it's applicable.
- Please format your PR's title with the same format.

> **_Please do everything you can to keep commits for a PR to a single package in `packages`._**

A sample commit and PR message should look like:

```text
[minor][feat] implement support for react-query
```

### Filing Issues

If you need help or found an issue, please [submit a github issue](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode/issues/new/choose).

## Updating Docs

Our docs use [docusaurus]. The source is in the directory `/docusaurus`. It's generated to `/docs` and published as github docs at <https://www.electrode.io/electrode>.

### To run the docs locally:

```bash
$ cd docusaurus
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm start
```

And open your browser to `http://localhost:4000` to view the docs locally.

### To generate documentations to `/docs`:

```bash
$ cd docusaurus
$ pnpm run deploy
```

## Process to publish packages

### Developer flow
- Developers commit all code changes.
- Run `rush change --target-branch <targetBranchWhichIsUsualyMaster>` 
  - This generates *change files*
- Commit *change files*
- Push the PR and get it reviewd and merged

### Publish flow
When its time to publish packages (as per release schedule)
- Pull latest from `master` branch
- Run `rush publish â€”apply`
    - This is [dry run mode]. 
    - Changes are added to the changelog files for each package.
    - The `package.json` files are updated with new version numbers and written to disk. Nothing is actually committed to the source repository or published at this point
    - Review the CHANGELOG.md updates at this point
- Run `rush publish --apply --target-branch main --publish --add-commit-details`
    - This will create a branch with `publish-*`
    - Publish the packages
    - And finally checkout back to *target branch* (`master` in this case)
- Checkout to publish branch that got created above 
- Push the changes as PR to get the `CHANGELOG.md` updated to `master`.
